## America's Health Rankings

[America's Health Rankings](https://www.americashealthrankings.org): The mission of America's Health Rankings (AHR) is to provide a wide variety of health and health-related information to help policymakers, advocates and individuals understand a population’s health in a holistic, inclusive manner. 

  * **Where you can see this data:** It exists [here.](https://features.texas2036.org/caseforaction/intro/13)
  * **How we used their data:** We used the latest version of each of the following three datasets in our narrative to compare Texas health outcomes to health outcomes in other states to understand where Texas fell in the bottom half of state rankings across the various measures that America's Health Rankings Reports on throughh their Annual Report, Health of Women and Children, and their Senior Report.
  
### The AHR 2018 Annual Report
  
  - [**The AHR 2018 Annual Report**](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/Overall/state/TX) is the longest running annual assessment of the nation’s health on a state-by-state basis. For nearly three decades, America’s Health Rankings® Annual Report has analyzed a comprehensive set of behaviors, public and health policies, community and environmental conditions, and clinical care data to provide a holistic view of the health of the people in the nation. 
  * The following measures came from AHR's Annual Report: _["Adverse Childhood Experiences"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/ACEs/state/TX), "[Cardiovascular Deaths"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/CVDDeaths/state/TX), ["Diabetes"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/Diabetes/state/TX), ["Infectious Disease"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/infectiousdisease/state/TX), ["Low Birthweight"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/birthweight/state/TX), ["Mental Health Providers"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/MHP/state/TX), ["Obesity"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/Obesity/state/TX), ["Preventable Hospitalizations"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/preventable/state/TX), ["Primary Care Physicians"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/PCP/state/TX), ["Stroke"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/Stroke/state/TX) and ["Uninsured"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/HealthInsurance/state/TX)_.
  - [**The AHR 2018 Health of Women and Children Report**](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/health-of-women-and-children/measure/overall_mch/state/TX?edition-year=2018) is the newest state rankings report. With a focus on women of reproductive age, infants and children under age 18, this report emphasizes the population groups where change can make generational differences.
      * The following measures came from AHR's Health of Women and Children Report: _["Immunizations - Children"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/health-of-women-and-children/measure/Immunize/state/TX?edition-year=2018), ["Maternal Mortality"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/health-of-women-and-children/measure/maternal_mortality/state/TX?edition-year=2018), and ["Supportive Neighborhoods"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/health-of-women-and-children/measure/supportiveneighborhood/state/TX?edition-year=2018)_.  
      * IMPORTANT NOTE: These datasets were pulled in during the first week of September. In the weeks since September 5th, the AHR 2019 Health of Women and Children Report was released. As we did not have sufficient time to include this recently released data, the 2019 AHR Health of Women and Children report will be integrated into these rankings as soon as possible: 
    - [**The AHR 2019 Senior Report**](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/senior/measure/overall_sr_2/state/TX) recently completed its fifth year of presenting a comparative health report for the U.S. population aged 65 and older. 
      * The following measures came from AHR's Senior Report: _"[Frequent Mental Distress - Seniors"](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/senior/measure/mental_disress_sr/state/TX)_.
