  * **Where you can see this data:** It exists [here.](https://features.texas2036.org/caseforaction/intro/13)
  * **How we used their data:** We used the latest version of each of the following three datasets in our narrative to compare Texas health outcomes to health outcomes in other states to understand where Texas fell in the bottom half of state rankings across the various measures that America's Health Rankings Reports on throughh their Annual Report, Health of Women and Children, and their Senior Report.

Why don't you take your Members Only jacket off and hang it on the coat rack? Blood, sweat and tears - it all stays right here on this field, right now! This is our dirt! This is our mud!

Using the census population variables for people whose poverty status was determined ("C17002_001E"), we can see understand that total population in mathematical form like this like this: 

$$ Tot_{PopulationSurveyed} = C17002\_001E$$
