## Our Values

> **ACTION** We believe Texans take action when faced with challenges, and that we’re proud and competitive enough to take on any challenge together. We know where the buck should stop, starting with individual and community responsibility, and extending to government accountability.

> **DIVERSITY** We believe a core value of being Texan is to be respectful, friendly and inclusive. We recognize our diversity as a strength and work towards including all Texans when setting future goals.

> **OPPORTUNITY**. We believe every Texan wants our state to be the best place to live and work, and to do that, we must promote opportunity and make sure everyone has the tools and chance to succeed.

> **PRAGMATISM**. We believe our state’s history of independence has led many Texans to be skeptical of government, but we also know Texans are practical and willing to come together to make the right – and sometimes tough – decisions when the case for action is made.

> **RESILIENCE** We believe Texans are generous, focused on family and community, and willing to help others in need, making us able to overcome any challenge facing our state now and into the future.
